## Overview

BreathState is a cross-platform mobile and desktop app designed to measure and analyze heart rate and breathing rate simultaneously. By connecting to a heart rate sensor (Polar H10) and using the device microphone, the app provides biofeedback metrics such as Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Resonance Frequency Breathing.  

It is **open-source**, making advanced biofeedback tools accessible for researchers, healthcare professionals, and individuals. The app provides guided breathing exercises and allows exporting recorded data for further analysis.
